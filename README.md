F-RSSReader is a flask based rss reader,which use HTML, CSS, and Javascript as front-end and no other libraries are used except JQuery.  No other library is used outside class-used libraries and Python3 in rear-end.

In the project, I wrote a method `analyze()` in `rss_analysis.py` . **This method supports RSS and Atom link xml formats, which means it support almost all feed links**. However, there are still some websites whose formats are not standard, you can test a link in  [Feed Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/feed/).

There are some sample in database, **so I suggest you do not delete it**. You can use username: 17205996, password: 17205996 or 17205995,17205995 to check.

The rss_list.txt stores many feed links, because find feed link in China Internet may difficult.

The rss_temp.xml is a temporary file, you may delete it.

**Due to network reasons, loading time cannot be determined, please be patient.**
